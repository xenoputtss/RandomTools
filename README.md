# Random Tools
we develop all sort of little things to help do/get our work done.  This repo is just an easy way for me to save everything I write so it is publicly viewable and easy for others to find.  Also since it is public the intention is to force me to do better security practices by not embeding passwords or other sensitive information and instead rely on other mechanisms for storing those.

## Password hash generator
Some tools need base64 encoded Basic Authentication tokens, why trust a website to do it when you can just run the code
